# EDA-ECommercePurchase
The "E-Commerce Purchase Dataset Analysis" project focuses on addressing a series of key questions to extract meaningful insights from a given dataset.

**Introduction**:
This Jupyter Notebook conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on an E-Commerce purchase dataset. The primary objectives of this analysis are to clean the data, gain insights into customer behavior, and demonstrate the use of various pandas functionalities for data manipulation and visualization.


**Data Cleansing**:

Loading Data: The analysis begins by loading the E-Commerce purchase dataset using pandas' read_csv function.
Handling Missing Values: We identify and handle missing values using methods such as dropping rows or imputing values.
Data Types: We check and convert data types as needed to ensure consistency.
Duplicate Records: Duplicate records are identified and removed to maintain data integrity.
Outliers: Outliers are detected and treated appropriately to prevent skewing of statistical 

**Data Summary**: 
We generate summary statistics for numerical and categorical variables to gain an initial understanding of the data.

throughout the notebook, we showcase various pandas functionalities, including data filtering, aggregation, merging, and reshaping
